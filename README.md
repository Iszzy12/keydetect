Keylogger Detection Tool
This is a Python-based keylogger detection tool with a GUI interface built using Tkinter. The tool scans running processes on your computer to identify any potentially suspicious applications that might function as keyloggers. It uses the psutil library to access and analyze process details, focusing on keywords that commonly appear in keylogger names.

Features
Suspicious Process Detection: The tool scans for processes containing terms like "keylogger," "logger," "keystroke," and "record."
Process Information: Displays process names and file paths for potential keyloggers.
User Interface: Simple Tkinter-based GUI for ease of use.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
psutil library (pip install psutil)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keylogger-detection-tool.git
cd keylogger-detection-tool
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the program:

bash
Copy code
python keylogger_detection.py
Click the "Start Scan" button in the GUI to begin scanning for potential keyloggers.

The results will display the process name and file path of any process that might be a keylogger.

Example Code Snippet
python
Copy code
# Detects and displays potential keyloggers based on process name keywords
for process in psutil.process_iter(attrs=["name", "exe", "pid"]):
    if any(keyword in process.info["name"].lower() for keyword in ["keylogger", "logger", "keystroke", "record"]):
        tree.insert("", "end", values=(process.info["name"], process.info["exe"]))
Project Structure
keylogger_detection.py: Main program file containing the GUI and scanning functions.
README.md: Project description and documentation.
Future Improvements
Enhanced Detection: Incorporate more complex detection logic based on process behavior or system calls.
Real-Time Monitoring: Add a background monitoring mode to alert users if a new suspicious process starts.
